        MIDI Tuning Standard (MTS) is a specification of precise musical pitch agreed to by the MIDI Manufacturers Association in the MIDI protocol.
        MTS allows for both a bulk tuning dump message, giving a tuning for each of 128 notes, and a tuning message for individual notes as they are played.

        The quantity log2 (Æ’ / 440 Hz) is the number of octaves above the 440-Hz concert A (it is negative if the frequency is below that pitch).
        Multiplying it by 12 gives the number of semitones above that frequency.
        Adding 69 gives the number of semitones above the C five octaves below middle C.
